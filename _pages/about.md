<p align="justify">Welcome to my homepage! I am a group manager and senior scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">IHPC</a>), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/">A*STAR</a>), Singapore. I lead the Reliable AI research group to improve AI safety and robustness. Prior to joining IHPC, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Sichuan University in 2018, supervised by Professor <a href="http://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1108/5359.htm">Dezhong Peng</a>. I was a joint PhD student at the University of Birmingham from Aug 2016 to Aug 2018, supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/">Xin Yao</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">My research is mainly on machine learning and optimisation. Related research topics include multimodal learning, adversarial robustness, domain generalisation, neural architecture search, foundation models, evolutionary multi-objective optimisation, and more.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dtv_LZkAAAAJ&hl=en"><img src="assets/img/gs.png" width="12px"></a></p>
