<p align="justify">Welcome to my homepage! I am a group leader and senior scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/">A*STAR</a>), Singapore. I am also a Senior Member of the IEEE. I lead the AI Safety Research Group focused on enhancing the AI safety and robustness for real-world deployment and application. Prior to joining A*STAR, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Sichuan University, China, in 2018, supervised by Professor Dezhong Peng. From 2016 to 2018, I was a joint PhD student at The University of Birmingham in the UK, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UUtYPl4AAAAJ">Professor Xin Yao</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">My research is mainly on machine learning and optimisation. Related research topics include AI safety, multimodal learning, domain generalisation, foundation models, evolutionary multi-objective optimisation, and more. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dtv_LZkAAAAJ&hl=en"><img src="assets/img/gs.png" width="12px"></a> </p>
