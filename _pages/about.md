Welcome to my homepage. I am a research scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">IHPC</a>), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/">A*STAR</a>), Singapore. I am also Group Manager of the <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/research/computing-intelligence">Efficient AI</a> team at IHPC, and we are devoted to improving data efficiency and computation efficiency in machine learning. Prior to joining IHPC, I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from Sichuan University in 2018, supervised by Professor <a href="http://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1108/5359.htm">Dezhong Peng</a>. From August 2016 to August 2018, I was a visiting PhD student at the University of Birmingham in the UK, supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/">Xin Yao</a>.

My research is mainly on efficient machine learning and safe & robust AI. Related research topics include representation learning, transfer learning, multimodal learning, model compression, neural architecture search, adversarial attacks & defences, etc.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dtv_LZkAAAAJ&hl=en"><img src="assets/img/gs.png" width="12px"></a>

**[Job Vacancies]** We have 2 research scientist positions available at A*STAR, Singapore. More details are available <a href="/assets/pdf/IHPC-AI-Jobs-EAI-Scientist.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>
