<p align="justify">Welcome to my homepage. I am a research scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">IHPC</a>), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/">A*STAR</a>), Singapore. I am also Group Manager of the <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/research/computing-intelligence">Efficient AI</a> research group at IHPC, and we are devoted to improving data efficiency and computation efficiency in machine learning. Prior to joining IHPC, I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from Sichuan University in 2018, supervised by Professor <a href="http://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1108/5359.htm">Dezhong Peng</a>. From August 2016 to August 2018, I was a joint PhD student at the University of Birmingham in the UK, supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/">Xin Yao</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">My research is mainly on machine learning and optimisation. Related research topics include representation learning, multimodal learning, safe & robust machine learning, neural architecture search, evolutionary multi-objective optimisation, and more.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dtv_LZkAAAAJ&hl=en"><img src="assets/img/gs.png" width="12px"></a></p>
